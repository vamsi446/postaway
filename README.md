PostAway is a dynamic and secure Node.js backend application that powers a social media platform. Developed with MongoDB and Mongoose for database management, the Express framework for efficient routing, and JWT for robust authentication, PostAway ensures a seamless and secure user experience.

With an advanced OTP verification system utilizing otp-generator and Nodemailer, the application prioritizes user security. PostAway also integrates Multer for file uploads, allowing users to share multimedia content seamlessly.

Users can create, update, and delete posts with images, engage with content through comments and likes, and manage friend requests. The application employs the Winston logger for effective error tracking and dotenv for secure management of environment variables.
